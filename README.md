# README.md File Creator 


 Hi. 
 
 This project dynamically tries to generate a high-quality, professional README.md file. 
 The contents of the file will be derived from the user's input from the command-line.
 
 This creator follows the suggested https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide 
 The application will be invoked using the "node index.js" command and will require installation of the npm inquirer package.
 The license badges can be sourced from https://shields.io/.
 
 Learning from this project will help me create a more industry-standard README file going forward. 
 
 The repository for this project can be found in:
 https://github.com/FlorSing/readme-creator

 A sample of a generated README.md file as well as the link is below:

 The video recording for the CLI interface demo is at:

 Thank you.
