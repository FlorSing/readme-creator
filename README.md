# README.md File Creator 

    
 ## Description 

 Hi. 
 
 This project dynamically tries to generate a high-quality professional README.md file. 
 The contents of the file will be derived from the user's input from the command-line.
 This creator is follows the suggested https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide 
 The application will be invoked using "node index.js" command and will require installation of the npm inquirer package.
 
 Learning from this project will help me create a more industry-standard README file. 
 
 The repository for this project can be found in:
