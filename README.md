Create a README file by using a command-line application


Hi.

This project is about trying to create a README.md file that meets professional standards.

It will be generated from the command-line using the Inquirer package in Node.js.

The application will be invoked by using the following command:
  node index.js
  
Thus, Node.js needs to be installed as well as the Inquirer.js package from npm.

Thank you.
